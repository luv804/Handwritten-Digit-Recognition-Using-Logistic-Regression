# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Logistic-Regression
## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance belongs to a given class or not. 
## Objectives of the Project
Handwritten digit recognition is an essential task in optical character recognition (OCR) systems, with applications in postal mail sorting, bank check processing, and various digital document systems. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model using Logistic Regression Algorithm for recognizing handwritten digits like : <br/>
