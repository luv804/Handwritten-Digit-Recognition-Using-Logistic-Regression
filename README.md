# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Logistic Regression
## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance belongs to a given class or not. 
## Objectives of the Project
Handwritten digit recognition is an essential task in optical character recognition (OCR) systems, with applications in postal mail sorting, bank check processing, and various digital document systems. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model using Logistic Regression Algorithm for recognizing handwritten digits like : <br/><br/>

## Python Libraries Used :
+ Matplotlib
+ Seaborn
+ Scikit-learn
## About the Dataset
The dataset used to train and test the model was sourced from Scikit-learn library's Digits dataset (load_digits)
## Results :
The model demonstrated an accuracy of 96% when evaluated on test data
The heatmap below visualizes the confusion matrix of our handwritten digit recognition model <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
From the above confusion matrix, we can infer that the model performs accurately on most digits.
